# SCOLiA

SCOLiA (Subtyping and Comparison Of LIsteria Assemblies) is a webserver for analyzing *Listeria monocytogenes* genomes. 

# User Guide

SCOLiA offers 5 different modules for analyzing *Listeria monogytogenes* genomes: genome assembly, gene prediction, functional annotation, and comparative genomics. Each of these steps can be executed independently by users.

## Genome Assembly

Users can provide .fastq files for up to 50 isolates, and the genome assembly tool. The default assembler is SPAdes, but SKESA can also be chosen as an assembler. Furthermore, users can select whether to perform trimming on the data or 

Trimming is optimized for reads generated using paired-end Illumina technology. 

After submitting the files to this page, the webserver will provide users with a quality control report generated using fastp and MultiQC, contigs for each sample

## Gene Prediction

## Functional Annotation

## Comparative Genomics
